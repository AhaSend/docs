## Overview

ahasend routes [subcommand] [flags]
```

Available subcommands:

Routes enable you to:

## List Routes

```bash
ahasend routes list
```

## Create Route

```bash
# Basic route
ahasend routes create \
  --match-recipient "support@example.com" \
  --forward-to "https://your-app.com/webhooks/inbound"

# With recipient pattern filtering
ahasend routes create \
  --match-recipient "*@help.example.com" \
  --forward-to "https://api.example.com/email-handler" \
  --description "Help desk routing"

# Advanced route with options
ahasend routes create \
  --match-recipient "support-*@example.com" \
  --forward-to "https://support.example.com/webhook" \
  --strip-replies \
  --group-by-conversation \
  --description "Support ticket routing"
```

## Get Route Details

```bash
ahasend routes get route_1234567890abcdef
```

## Update Route

```bash
# Update webhook URL
ahasend routes update route_1234567890abcdef \
  --forward-to "https://new-api.example.com/webhook"

# Update recipient pattern
ahasend routes update route_1234567890abcdef \
  --match-recipient "new-pattern@example.com"

# Update processing options
ahasend routes update route_1234567890abcdef \
  --strip-replies \
  --group-by-conversation
```

## Delete Route

```bash
ahasend routes delete route_1234567890abcdef
```

## Listen for Events (Development)

Listen for inbound email routing events in real-time:

```bash
# Listen with existing route
ahasend routes listen --route-id route_1234567890abcdef

# Listen with temporary route pattern
ahasend routes listen --recipient "*@example.com"

# Forward events to local endpoint
ahasend routes listen \
  --recipient "support-*@example.com" \
  --forward-to http://localhost:3000/webhook
```

<Note>
Attachment data is not sent over WebSocket for performance reasons. Only email metadata and content are transmitted.
</Note>

## Trigger Test Events (Development)

Manually trigger route events for testing:

```bash
ahasend routes trigger route_1234567890abcdef
```
