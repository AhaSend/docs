## Server Endpoints

AhaSend operates SMTP servers in multiple regions for optimal performance:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="European Server" icon="earth-europe">
    **Hostname:** `send.ahasend.com`<br />
    **Location:** Germany (Primary)<br />
    **Best for:** European and global traffic
  </Card>
  <Card title="US Server" icon="earth-americas">
    **Hostname:** `send-us.ahasend.com`<br />
    **Location:** Oregon, USA<br />
    **Best for:** North American traffic
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Tip>
**Server selection:** Choose the server closest to your application for best performance. Both servers offer identical functionality and delivery capabilities.
</Tip>

## Connection Settings

### Supported Ports & Encryption

All AhaSend SMTP servers support the following configurations:

```
Servers: send.ahasend.com | send-us.ahasend.com
Ports: 25, 587, 2525
Encryption: STARTTLS (required)
Authentication: PLAIN (required)
```

<Warning>
**SMTPS not supported:** AhaSend does not support implicit SSL/TLS (SMTPS) on port 465. Use STARTTLS on ports 25, 587, or 2525 instead.
</Warning>

### Authentication Requirements

- **Authentication Method:** PLAIN authentication over STARTTLS
- **Username:** Your SMTP username from the dashboard
- **Password:** Your SMTP password from the dashboard
- **STARTTLS:** Required for all connections

<Note>
**Get SMTP credentials:** Create SMTP credentials in your [AhaSend Dashboard](https://dash.ahasend.com) in the "Credentials" page or via the [API](/api-reference/smtp-credentials/create-smtp-credential).
</Note>

## Connection Limits & Specifications

Understanding AhaSend's SMTP limits helps you optimize your email sending:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Recipients Per Message" icon="users">
    **Limit:** 50 recipients maximum per message

    This is the maximum number of consecutive `RCPT TO` commands that can be issued for a single SMTP transaction.

    ```
    MAIL FROM: <sender@yourdomain.com>
    RCPT TO: <user1@example.com>
    RCPT TO: <user2@example.com>
    ... (up to 50 recipients)
    DATA
    ```

    <Tip>
    For bulk sending to more recipients, send multiple separate messages or use our [HTTP API](/api/send-email) with batch operations.
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Message Size Limit" icon="file-zipper">
    **Limit:** 20 MB maximum per message

    Messages exceeding this size will be rejected with an error code. This includes:
    - Email headers
    - Message body (text and HTML)
    - All attachments (base64 encoded)

    <Warning>
    Remember that attachments are base64 encoded, increasing their size by approximately 33%. A 15MB file becomes ~20MB when encoded.
    </Warning>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Messages Per Connection" icon="envelopes-bulk">
    **Limit:** 10,000 messages maximum per connection

    This is the maximum number of consecutive `MAIL FROM` commands that can be issued for a single SMTP connection.

    When this limit is reached:
    - Additional `MAIL FROM` commands return transient failures
    - You should close and reopen the connection
    - Existing queued messages are not affected

    <Note>
    Most SMTP libraries handle connection pooling automatically, but you may need to configure this for high-volume applications.
    </Note>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Connection Timeout" icon="clock">
    **Timeout:** 1 minute of inactivity

    Connections are automatically closed if there's no new data within 60 seconds. This applies to:
    - Idle connections between commands
    - Slow data transmission during `DATA` command
    - Unresponsive clients

    <Tip>
    Keep connections active or implement proper reconnection logic in your application to handle timeouts gracefully.
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## SMTP Response Codes

AhaSend returns standard SMTP response codes with specific meanings:

### Success Codes

| Code | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `250` | **OK** - Message queued successfully for delivery |

### Error Codes

| Code | Description | Action Required |
|------|-------------|-----------------|
| `421` | **Load shedding** - Server overwhelmed, cannot accept new connections | Retry later with exponential backoff |
| `451` | **Internal server error** - Temporary server issue | Retry the request |
| `500` | **Invalid credentials** - Authentication failed | Check username/password |
| `521` | **Account disabled** - Account suspended or out of credits | Check account status in dashboard |
| `552` | **Invalid message format** - Malformed email content | Validate email structure and headers |
| `553` | **Email rejected** - Recipient domain is toxic, temporary, or has typos | Verify recipient domain |
| `556` | **Invalid account or domain** - Account or sending domain not configured | Verify domain setup |

<Warning>
**553 email Rejection:** This response requires [domain protection](/security/protection) to be enabled in your account settings.
</Warning>

## Special Headers

AhaSend supports special email headers that modify system behavior:

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Connection Management">
    **Optimize your SMTP connections:**

    - Reuse connections when sending multiple emails
    - Implement connection pooling for high-volume sending
    - Handle timeouts and reconnections gracefully
    - Close connections properly when done
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Error Handling">
    **Handle SMTP errors appropriately:**

    - Implement exponential backoff for `421` responses
    - Retry `451` errors with reasonable delays
    - Don't retry `5xx` errors (permanent failures)
    - Log error codes for debugging and monitoring
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Performance Optimization">
    **Maximize sending performance:**

    - Use persistent connections for batch sending (up to 10k messages per connection)
    - Choose the server closest to your application
    - Monitor connection limits and adjust accordingly
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Security Considerations

<Warning>
**Always use STARTTLS:** Unencrypted SMTP connections are not secure and may expose your credentials and email content.
</Warning>

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Credential Security" icon="shield-check">
    - Store SMTP credentials securely
    - Use environment variables, not hardcoded values
    - Rotate credentials regularly
    - Use scoped credentials when possible
  </Card>
  <Card title="Domain Authentication" icon="certificate">
    - Verify your sending domains
    - Configure SPF, DKIM, and DMARC records
    - Use dedicated sending domains
    - Monitor domain reputation
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Info>
**Prefer HTTP API?** While SMTP is great for compatibility, our [HTTP API](/api/send-email) offers better performance, features, and error handling for modern applications.
