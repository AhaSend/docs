<Update label="January 2026">
#### Security

- Improved session security with automatic session refresh after login and password reset.

#### New Features

- **Contact List Validation**: Automatically validate your contact lists before sending campaigns. The system checks email syntax, MX records, and uses external verification services to identify invalid or risky addresses. Campaigns with high bounce risk are flagged for review before sending.
- **Campaign Cancellation & Rescheduling**: Cancel scheduled campaigns or validation in progress, and reschedule campaigns with a new send time.
- Campaigns now send emails faster with concurrent delivery.
- Added delete campaign option with confirmation on the campaign edit page.
- Email notifications for campaign reviews: get notified when your campaign is pending review, approved, or requires changes.

#### Changes

- Dashboard charts now include campaign email statistics alongside transactional emails.
- "Deferrals" renamed to "Deferred Attempts" on the dashboard for clarity.
- Recent messages section now labeled "Recent transactional messages" to distinguish from campaigns.
- [Send Message API](/api-reference/messages/create-message) now automatically detects template format based on whether substitutions are provided.

#### Improvements

- Suppression rate calculations now include campaign recipients for more accurate metrics.
- Campaign report page redesigned with separate views for campaigns being validated, scheduled, or paused.
- Many improvements and bugfixes for the Email Template Designer: fixed inline images breaking on edits, added undo/redo buttons, fixed color picker positioning, and resolved image resize issues.
