<Info>
**API v1 Documentation:** This document covers API v1, which is easier to use and get started with if you just want to send emails. For API v2, which provides more advanced features and controls, check our [API v2 Authentication guide](/api-reference/authentication).
</Info>

API keys allow you to authenticate with AhaSend's HTTP REST API to send emails using standard HTTP requests. This guide will walk you through creating, configuring, and managing your API keys for optimal email delivery performance.

<Info>
**High-Performance Email Delivery:** API keys are perfect for high-volume email sending. If you're sending more than 5-10 emails per second, the HTTP API provides better performance and throughput than SMTP.
</Info>

## What are API Keys?

API keys are authentication tokens that allow your application to make authenticated HTTP requests to AhaSend's REST API. Unlike SMTP credentials, API keys are designed for:

- **High-volume sending** with superior performance and throughput
- **Modern web applications** that prefer HTTP over SMTP
- **Microservices architectures** requiring REST API integration
- **Advanced features** like templating, bulk operations, and detailed analytics
- **Better error handling** with detailed HTTP response codes

## Creating API Keys

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access Credentials Dashboard" icon="user">
    1. **Log in** to your [AhaSend Dashboard](https://dash.ahasend.com)
    2. **Navigate** to the **Credentials** section from the main menu
    3. **Click** the **"Create Credential"** button
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Credential Settings" icon="gear">
    **Select Credential Type:**
    - Choose **"API Key"** as the credential type

    **Choose a Descriptive Name:**
    - Use a name that helps you identify this API key later
    - Examples: "Production API", "example.com API", "Marketing Platform"

    <Tip>
    **Naming Tip:** If you have multiple domains or applications, include descriptive information in your API key name (e.g., "example.com Production API", "Newsletter Service") to make management easier.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set Credential Mode" icon="vial">
    Choose the appropriate mode for your use case:

    **Production Mode:**
    - Sends emails to real recipients
    - Use for live applications and real email delivery
    - Emails are delivered normally

    **Sandbox Mode:**
    - Simulates email sending without actual delivery to recipients
    - Perfect for testing and development environments
    - Completely free - doesn't count toward your email credits
    - Still triggers webhooks for testing your integrations

    <Info>
    **Sandbox Benefits:** Sandbox mode processes emails just like production (including webhook events) but stops short of actual delivery. This makes it perfect for testing your integration safely. [Learn more about sandbox mode â†’](/smtp/sandbox)
    </Info>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Credential Scope" icon="shield">
    **Global Scope (Recommended):**
    - Works with all domains in your account
    - Simplest option for most users
    - Can be changed later if needed

    **Domain-Specific Scope:**
    - Restricts API key to specific domains
    - Better security for multi-domain setups
    - Requires separate API keys per domain

  </Step>

  <Step title="Generate and Save API Key" icon="key">
    1. **Click** "Create Credential" to generate your API key
    2. **Copy and securely store** the API key
    3. **Save it** in your password manager or secure storage
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Managing API Keys

### Viewing Your API Keys

Once created, you can view and manage your API keys in the dashboard:

- **Name/Label:** The descriptive name you gave the API key
- **Key Preview:** First few characters of the API key for identification
- **Mode:** Can be changed between Production and Sandbox
- **Scope:** Can be modified to adjust domain restrictions
- **Created:** When the API key was created
