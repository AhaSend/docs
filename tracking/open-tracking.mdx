Open tracking allows you to monitor when recipients open your emails by embedding an invisible tracking pixel. This feature provides valuable insights into email engagement, though it comes with inherent accuracy limitations that are important to understand.

<Warning>
**Accuracy Limitations:** Open tracking is inherently inaccurate due to email client behavior, bot activity, and privacy features. Use open tracking data as approximate engagement indicators rather than precise metrics.
</Warning>

## How Open Tracking Works

Open tracking works by embedding a tiny, invisible 1x1 pixel image at the end of your HTML emails. When a recipient opens the email and their email client loads images, it makes a request to AhaSend's servers to fetch this tracking pixel, which registers as an "open" event.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="The Tracking Process" icon="chart-line">
    1. **Pixel Insertion:** AhaSend automatically adds an invisible tracking pixel to HTML emails
    2. **Email Delivery:** Email is delivered to the recipient's inbox
    3. **Email Opened:** Recipient opens the email in their email client
    4. **Image Loading:** Email client attempts to load images (including the tracking pixel)
    5. **Open Recorded:** When the pixel loads, AhaSend records an open event
    6. **Analytics Updated:** Open data appears in your dashboard and webhooks
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Tracking Pixel Details" icon="image">
    - **Size:** 1x1 pixel (invisible to recipients)
    - **Location:** Automatically inserted at the end of HTML emails
    - **Format:** Transparent image served from AhaSend's servers
    - **Requirements:** HTML email format (not available for plain text)
    - **Privacy:** Removed before email delivery, never visible to recipients
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Common Accuracy Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="False Negatives (Missed Opens)" icon="eye-slash">
    **Common causes of untracked opens:**
    - Email clients with images disabled by default (Gmail, Outlook, Apple Mail)
    - Recipients reading emails in plain text mode
    - Email service providers filtering out tracking pixels
    - Privacy-focused email clients blocking external images
    - Corporate firewalls blocking image requests

    **Impact:** Actual open rates are likely higher than reported
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="False Positives (Inflated Opens)" icon="robot">
    **Common causes of inflated opens:**
    - Email security scanners and bot activity
    - Email client prefetching images
    - Preview pane functionality triggering opens
    - Automated email processing systems
    - Anti-virus software scanning email content

    **Impact:** Reported open rates may be higher than actual human engagement
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Timing Considerations" icon="clock">
    **Open detection timing:**
    - Opens may be delayed if images load slowly
    - Some clients cache images, preventing multiple open detection
    - Network issues can delay or prevent tracking
    - Mobile clients may load images differently than desktop
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Privacy Considerations

Open tracking has significant privacy implications that you should consider:

<Warning>
**Privacy Compliance:** Ensure your use of open tracking complies with applicable privacy laws (GDPR, CCPA, etc.) in your jurisdiction. Consider disclosing tracking in your privacy policy.
</Warning>

### Privacy Impact

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Information Collected" icon="database">
    When someone opens a tracked email, AhaSend may collect:
    - **Timestamp:** When the email was opened
    - **IP Address:** Recipient's approximate location
    - **User Agent:** Email client and device information
    - **Open Count:** How many times the email was opened
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Recipient Awareness" icon="eye">
    **Recipients typically cannot see:**
    - The tracking pixel (invisible 1x1 image)
    - That their opens are being tracked
    - What information is being collected

    **Recipients may notice:**
    - External image loading warnings in some clients
    - Slight delay when opening emails with tracking
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Opt-out Considerations" icon="shield">
    **Recipients can avoid tracking by:**
    - Disabling image loading in their email client
    - Using email clients with built-in privacy protection
    - Reading emails in plain text mode
    - Using browser extensions that block tracking pixels
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Enabling Open Tracking

Open tracking can be controlled at different levels depending on how you send emails:

### Account-Wide Settings

Configure your default open tracking preference in your AhaSend dashboard:

1. Navigate to **[Account Settings](https://dash.ahasend.com/account/-/settings)** in your dashboard
2. Toggle **Open Tracking** on or off
3. This setting applies to all emails unless overridden per message

### Per-Message Override

Override account settings for individual emails using different methods:

## SMTP with Special Headers

For SMTP email sending, use the `ahasend-track-opens` header to control tracking:

```plaintext SMTP Example
From: hello@yourdomain.com
To: user@example.com
Subject: Newsletter with Open Tracking
ahasend-track-opens: true
Content-Type: text/html

<html>
<body>
<h1>Your Newsletter</h1>
<p>This email will track opens even if account-wide tracking is disabled.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

<Note>
**Header Details:** The `ahasend-track-opens` header accepts `true` or `false` values and overrides your account-wide open tracking setting for individual emails.
</Note>

For complete SMTP header documentation, see [Special Email Headers](/smtp/special-headers).

## API v2 Implementation

API v2 (`/v2/accounts/{account_id}/messages`) provides native support for tracking configuration:

```json API v2 Example
{
  "from": {
    "email": "hello@yourdomain.com",
    "name": "Your Company"
  },
  "recipients": [
    {
      "email": "user@example.com",
      "name": "John Doe"
    }
  ],
  "subject": "Newsletter with Open Tracking",
  "html_content": "<h1>Newsletter</h1><p>This email will track opens.</p>",
  "tracking": {
    "open": true
  }
}
```

<Info>
**API v2 Advantage:** API v2 provides dedicated `tracking` field at the root level, making it easier to manage tracking settings without dealing with custom headers.
</Info>

For complete API v2 documentation, see [Send Emails using the API](/api-reference/messages/create-message).

## API v1 Implementation

For API v1 (`/v1/email/send`), include tracking headers in the `content.headers` field:

```json API v1 Example
{
  "from": {
    "name": "Your Company",
    "email": "hello@yourdomain.com"
  },
  "recipients": [
    {
      "name": "John Doe",
      "email": "user@example.com"
    }
  ],
  "content": {
    "subject": "Newsletter with Tracking",
    "html_body": "<h1>Newsletter</h1><p>Track opens for this email.</p>",
    "headers": {
      "ahasend-track-opens": "true"
    }
  }
}
```
