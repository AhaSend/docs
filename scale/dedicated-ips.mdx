Dedicated IP addresses provide enhanced deliverability, faster delivery speeds, and complete control over your sending reputation. Perfect for high-volume senders who need predictable email performance.

<Info>
**Free for High-Volume Senders:** Dedicated IPs are available starting at 100,000 emails/month, with one dedicated IP included for customers sending over 300,000 emails/month.

## When Shared IPs Are Better

For many senders, especially those with lower or inconsistent volumes, shared IPs may actually provide better deliverability:

<Note>
**Shared IP Benefits:** A shared IP is used by multiple senders and typically has an established, well-maintained reputation. This means your emails benefit from the positive sending history of the group, helping improve inbox placement—even if your own volume is low or inconsistent.
</Note>

**Shared IPs Are Ideal When:**
- **Low Volume:** Sending fewer than 100,000 emails per month
- **Inconsistent Sending:** Irregular or seasonal email sending
- **New Sender:** Building your initial sending reputation
- **Cost Efficiency:** Want to avoid dedicated IP management overhead

## The Dedicated IP Challenge for Low-Volume Senders

### The "Warming Up" Problem

A new dedicated IP needs to be warmed up gradually—this means slowly ramping up the number of emails you send to gain trust with inbox providers. If you send fewer than 100,000 emails per month consistently:

**Volume Issues:**
- **Insufficient Warm-up:** You may never send enough volume to warm up the IP effectively
- **Cold IP Risk:** The IP can go cold between campaigns, harming your deliverability
- **Suspicious Patterns:** ISPs may flag your emails as suspicious due to irregular or low sending patterns

**Reputation Challenges:**
- **No Safety Net:** Unlike shared IPs, you don't benefit from other senders' positive reputation
- **Recovery Difficulty:** Reputation issues are harder to recover from with low volume
- **Time Investment:** Proper IP warming can take months with limited sending volume

<Warning>
**Minimum Volume Needed:** Effective dedicated IP management typically requires consistent volume of at least 100,000 emails monthly to maintain reputation and deliverability.
</Warning>
