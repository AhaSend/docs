Use your own IP addresses for outgoing email by providing a VPS that holds your dedicated IP addresses. This gives you complete control over your sending infrastructure and IP reputation.

<Tip>
**Max Plan Feature:** Bring Your Own IP is available exclusively on the [Max plan](https://ahasend.com/pricing) as an add-on. [Contact our sales team](https://ahasend.com/contact) to discuss setup and pricing.
</Tip>

<Warning>
**Advanced Setup:** BYOIP comes with unique challenges similar to dedicated IP management. Ensure you understand IP reputation, deliverability requirements, and maintenance responsibilities before proceeding.
