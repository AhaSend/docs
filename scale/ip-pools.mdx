Organize your dedicated IP addresses into customized pools for different email types, domains, or sending strategies. IP pools provide advanced segmentation and reputation management for complex sending requirements.

<Tip>
**Enterprise Feature:** IP Pool Management is available exclusively on Enterprise plans. [Contact our sales team](https://ahasend.com/contact) to discuss your IP pooling requirements.
</Tip>

<Info>
**Prerequisites:** IP pools require multiple dedicated IPs. You'll need to be eligible for [dedicated IP addresses](/scale/dedicated-ips) first.
</Info>

## What Are IP Pools?

IP pools allow you to group dedicated IP addresses and assign them to specific email types, domains, or sending strategies. Instead of using all your IPs for all email types, you can create targeted pools for optimal deliverability and reputation management.

**Example Configuration:**
- **Transactional Pool:** Order confirmations, password resets, account notifications
- **Marketing Pool:** Newsletters, promotional campaigns, announcements
- **Domain-Specific Pools:** Separate IPs for different brands or subdomains
