Setting up your domain correctly is **essential** for email deliverability. This guide walks you through adding and verifying your domain with AhaSend to ensure your emails reach the inbox, not the spam folder.

<Warning>
**Domain verification is required** before you can send any emails through AhaSend. Unverified domains cannot send emails and will result in API errors.
</Warning>

## Why Domain Setup Matters

Email receivers use multiple authentication methods to verify that emails are legitimate. When you properly configure your domain with AhaSend, you're telling receiving servers that:

1. **You own the domain** and have the rights to send emails from it
2. **You've authorized AhaSend** to send emails on behalf of your domain
3. **Your emails are authentic** and not spoofed or malicious

Without proper domain setup, your emails will either be **rejected outright** or **land in spam folders**, significantly impacting your delivery rates.

<Tip>
**Subdomain recommendation:** Use a subdomain like `email.yourcompany.com` instead of your main domain for transactional emails. This isolates your transactional email reputation from marketing campaigns.
</Tip>

## Prerequisites

Before setting up your domain, make sure you have:

- **Access to your DNS provider** (usually your hosting provider or domain registrar)
- **An AhaSend account** with verified email address
- **The domain or subdomain** you want to use for sending emails

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add Your Domain" icon="plus">
    Start by adding your domain to your AhaSend account:

    1. **Log in to your [AhaSend Dashboard](https://dash.ahasend.com)**
    2. **Navigate to Domains** in the sidebar
    3. **Click "Add Domain"**
    4. **Enter your domain name** (e.g., `email.yourcompany.com`)
    5. **Click "Create Domain"**

    You'll be redirected to the domain details page where you can see all required DNS records.

    <Info>
    **API Alternative:** You can also add domains programmatically using our [Domains API](/api-reference/domains/create-domain).
    </Info>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure DNS Records" icon="gear">
    Add the following DNS records to your domain. All records are provided in your domain details page with exact values for your domain.

    <AccordionGroup>
      <Accordion title="SPF Record (Required)" icon="shield-check">
        **Sender Policy Framework (SPF)** authorizes AhaSend to send emails on your domain's behalf.

        **Record Type:** `TXT`
        **Purpose:** Prevents email spoofing by specifying authorized sending servers

        ```
        Name: @ (or your subdomain)
        Type: TXT
        Value: v=spf1 include:_spf.ahasend.com ~all
        ```

        <Warning>
        If you already have an SPF record, **do not create a duplicate**. Instead, add `include:_spf.ahasend.com` to your existing SPF record before the final mechanism (`~all` or `-all`).
        </Warning>
      </Accordion>

      <Accordion title="DKIM Record (Required)" icon="signature">
        **DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM)** cryptographically signs your emails to verify authenticity.

        **Record Type:** `TXT`
        **Purpose:** Prevents email tampering and confirms sender identity

        ```
        Name: [unique-selector]._domainkey
        Type: TXT
        Value: [unique DKIM public key]
        ```

        <Note>
        The exact DKIM record name and value are unique for each domain and provided in your dashboard. Copy them exactly as shown.
        </Note>
      </Accordion>

      <Accordion title="DMARC Record (Required)" icon="shield-halved">
        **Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting and Conformance (DMARC)** provides policy guidance for email authentication failures.

        **Record Type:** `TXT`
        **Purpose:** Protects your domain from email spoofing and phishing attacks

        ```
        Name: _dmarc
        Type: TXT
        Value: v=DMARC1; p=quarantine; rua=mailto:dmarc@ahasend.com
        ```

        <Info>
        This DMARC policy tells receiving servers to quarantine emails that fail authentication and send reports to AhaSend for monitoring.
        </Info>
      </Accordion>

      <Accordion title="Return-Path Record (Highly Recommended)" icon="reply">
        **Return-Path** specifies where bounce messages and delivery notifications should be sent.

        **Record Type:** `CNAME`
        **Purpose:** Improves deliverability by providing a communication channel for bounce handling

        ```
        Name: bounces (or your specified subdomain)
        Type: CNAME
        Value: bounces.ahasend.com
        ```

        <Tip>
        While not strictly required, the Return-Path record significantly improves deliverability by allowing AhaSend to properly handle bounces and feedback loops.
        </Tip>
      </Accordion>

      <Accordion title="Email Tracking Record (Optional)" icon="chart-line">
        **Tracking Domain** ensures tracking URLs in your emails come from your domain instead of AhaSend's.

        **Record Type:** `CNAME`
        **Purpose:** Improves deliverability and maintains brand consistency for tracked links

        ```
        Name: track (or your specified subdomain)
        Type: CNAME
        Value: track.ahasend.com
        ```

        <Note>
        Email tracking is **disabled by default** and must be explicitly enabled in your account settings, even if you configure the tracking domain.
        </Note>
      </Accordion>

      <Accordion title="MX Record (Recommended)" icon="envelope">
        **Mail Exchanger (MX)** specifies the mail server responsible for receiving emails for your domain.

        **Record Type:** `MX`
        **Purpose:** Required for receiving emails, recommended for better sending reputation

        ```
        Name: @ (or your subdomain)
        Type: MX
        Priority: 10
        Value: mx.ahasend.com
        ```

        <Info>
        While not required for sending emails, some receiving servers penalize domains without MX records. Adding this record improves overall deliverability.
        </Info>
      </Accordion>
    </AccordionGroup>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Wait for DNS Propagation" icon="clock">
    DNS changes can take time to propagate across the internet:

    - **Typical time:** 5-30 minutes
    - **Maximum time:** Up to 48 hours
    - **Check status:** Use online DNS checkers to verify your records are live

    <Tip>
    **Pro tip:** Use tools like [DNS Checker](https://dnschecker.org/) or [What's My DNS](https://www.whatsmydns.net/) to verify your records have propagated globally.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify Your Domain" icon="check-circle">
    Once your DNS records are live, verify your domain in AhaSend:

    1. **Return to your domain details page** in the dashboard
    2. **Click "Check DNS"** to run verification
    3. **Wait for confirmation** - this usually takes just a few seconds
    4. **Look for the green checkmarks** next to each record type

    <Check>
    **Success!** When all records show green checkmarks, your domain is verified and ready to send emails.
    </Check>

    <Warning>
    If verification fails, double-check that:
    - All DNS records are added exactly as shown
    - DNS changes have had time to propagate
    - You don't have conflicting DNS records
    </Warning>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="DNS Records Not Verifying">
    **Common causes and solutions:**

    - **Wait longer:** DNS propagation can take up to 48 hours
    - **Check record values:** Ensure exact copy-paste from dashboard (no extra spaces)
    - **Verify record type:** TXT records for SPF/DKIM/DMARC, CNAME for others
    - **Remove duplicates:** Don't create multiple SPF records
    - **Check with DNS tools:** Use online DNS checkers to verify records are live
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Existing SPF Record Conflicts">
    **If you already have an SPF record:**

    1. **Don't create a duplicate** - domains can only have one SPF record
    2. **Modify your existing record** by adding `include:_spf.ahasend.com`
    3. **Place it before the final mechanism** (`~all` or `-all`)

    Example:
    ```
    OLD: v=spf1 include:_spf.google.com ~all
    NEW: v=spf1 include:_spf.google.com include:_spf.ahasend.com ~all
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Subdomain vs Root Domain">
    **Understanding the difference:**

    - **Root domain:** `yourcompany.com` (affects all subdomains)
    - **Subdomain:** `email.yourcompany.com` (isolated setup)

    **For subdomains:** Add all DNS records to the specific subdomain, not the root domain.
  </Accordion>
