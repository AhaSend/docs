Allow your team members to log in using your organization's existing identity provider such as Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD), Google Workspace, Okta, Authentik, or Zitadel.

<Tip>
**Enterprise Feature:** OpenID Connect SSO is available exclusively on Enterprise plans. [Contact our sales team](https://ahasend.com/contact) to upgrade your account.
</Tip>

<Info>
**Account Owner Access:** Only the account owner can configure SSO and bypass it when necessary. Team members must use SSO once enabled.
</Info>

## Configuration

Configure SSO in your account settings as the account owner:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enable SSO" icon="toggle-on">
    **Navigate to SSO settings:**
    1. **Go to** **Account Settings** in your dashboard
    2. **Scroll to** **OpenID Connect SSO** section
    3. **Check** "Enable OpenID Connect SSO"
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Identity Provider" icon="gear">
    **Enter your IdP details:**

    **Required Configuration:**
    - **Configuration Type:** PKCE (recommended) or Client Credentials
    - **Domain:** Comma-separated email domains (e.g., `yourcompany.com`)
    - **Issuer URL:** Base URL from your IdP (e.g., `https://iam.company.com`)
    - **Client ID:** Provided by your identity provider
    - **Client Secret:** Provided by your identity provider

    **Optional Settings:**
    - **Requested Scopes:** Space-separated scopes (defaults: `openid email profile`)
    - **Authorization Endpoint:** e.g., `https://iam.company.com/oauth/v2/authorize`
    - **Token Endpoint:** e.g., `https://iam.company.com/oauth/v2/token`
    - **Userinfo Endpoint:** e.g., `https://iam.company.com/oauth/v2/userinfo`
    - **JWKS URI:** e.g., `https://iam.company.com/oauth/v2/keys`
  </Step>

  <Step title="Validate and Activate" icon="check">
    **Complete SSO setup:**
    1. **Save** your configuration
    2. **System validates** the settings automatically
    3. **SSO activates** if validation is successful
  </Step>
</Steps>

## How SSO Works

Once OpenID Connect SSO is activated:

**Team Member Access:**
- **Must use SSO:** All team members must sign in through your identity provider
- **No regular login:** Standard AhaSend login credentials are disabled
- **Access denied:** Password reset requests are blocked for team members

**Account Owner Access:**
- **SSO bypass:** Can still use regular AhaSend credentials
- **Password reset:** Can request password resets when needed
- **Full control:** Can disable SSO if necessary

<Warning>
**Team Access:** Only users explicitly added as team members can access the account after SSO is enabled.
</Warning>
