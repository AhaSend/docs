Add an extra layer of security to your AhaSend account with Two-Factor Authentication (2FA). After entering your password, you'll need a time-based code from your smartphone's authenticator app, making your account significantly more secure against unauthorized access.

<Info>
**Enhanced Security:** Even if someone obtains your password, they cannot access your account without your physical device and authenticator app.
</Info>

## Why Enable 2FA?

Your AhaSend account controls critical email infrastructure and sensitive data. 2FA provides essential protection by requiring two forms of authentication:

1. **Something you know** - Your password
2. **Something you have** - Your smartphone with the authenticator app

## Setting Up 2FA

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access Security Settings" icon="gear">
    **Navigate to your account security options:**
    1. **Log in** to your AhaSend dashboard
    2. **Go to** your **[Profile](https://dash.ahasend.com//profile)**
    3. **Click** "Enable Two-Factor Authentication"
  </Step>

  <Step title="Install Authenticator App" icon="mobile">
    **Download a TOTP authenticator app on your smartphone:**

    **Recommended Apps:**
    - **Google Authenticator** (iOS/Android)
    - **Microsoft Authenticator** (iOS/Android)
    - **Twilio Authy** (iOS/Android)
    - **1Password** (with TOTP support)

    **Secure your backup codes (Critical Step):**
