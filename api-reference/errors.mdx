## Error Response Format

All API errors return a consistent JSON structure with an HTTP status code and a descriptive message:

```json
{
  "message": "Error description explaining what went wrong"
}
```

The `message` field provides detailed information about the nature of the error, helping you understand what went wrong and how to fix it.

## HTTP Status Codes

The AhaSend API uses standard HTTP status codes to indicate the success or failure of requests:

### 2xx Success

- **200 OK** - Request succeeded
- **201 Created** - Resource created successfully

### 4xx Client Errors

#### 400 Bad Request

Returned when the request is malformed or contains invalid parameters.

<Warning>
Common causes include invalid JSON, missing required fields, or parameters that don't meet validation requirements.
</Warning>

**Example scenarios:**
- Invalid UUID format for `account_id` or resource IDs
- Malformed email addresses
- Invalid time formats (expecting RFC3339)
- Parameters outside allowed ranges (e.g., `limit` not between 1-100)
- Invalid domain names or URLs
- Malformed request body

```json
{
  "message": "invalid account_id"
}
```

```json
{
  "message": "invalid from_time, provide a valid RFC3339 time string"
}
```

#### 401 Unauthorized

Authentication failed or is missing.

**Common causes:**
- Missing `Authorization` header
- Invalid API key format (must be `Bearer <api_key>`)
- API key doesn't exist or has been revoked
- Account associated with API key is suspended
- API key doesn't belong to the specified account

```json
{
  "message": "Missing or malformed bearer token"
}
```

```json
{
  "message": "Invalid API key"
}
```

```json
{
  "message": "Account is suspended"
}
```

#### 403 Forbidden

Authentication succeeded, but you don't have permission to access the resource.

<Tip>
This typically occurs when your API key doesn't have the required scopes for the operation you're trying to perform.
</Tip>

**Common causes:**
- API key lacks required scopes (e.g., trying to delete domains without `domains:delete` scope)
- Attempting to access resources outside your API key's domain restrictions
- Insufficient permissions for specific operations

```json
{
  "message": "Insufficient permissions for the required scope"
}
```

```json
{
  "message": "api key does not have sufficient permissions to read webhooks"
}
```

#### 404 Not Found

The requested resource doesn't exist or you don't have access to it.

**Common scenarios:**
- Resource ID doesn't exist
- Resource was deleted
- Resource belongs to a different account

```json
{
  "message": "account not found"
}
```

```json
{
  "message": "domain not found"
}
```

#### 409 Conflict

The request conflicts with the current state of the resource.

**Common causes:**
- **Idempotency conflicts**: Another request with the same idempotency key is already in progress
- **Resource conflicts**: Trying to create a resource that already exists (e.g., duplicate domain)

```json
{
  "message": "A request with this idempotency key is already in progress"
}
```

```json
{
  "message": "domain already exists"
}
```

#### 412 Precondition Failed

Returned for failed idempotency conditions.

```json
{
  "message": "The original request with this idempotency key failed and cannot be retried"
}
```

#### 429 Too Many Requests

You've exceeded the API rate limits.

<Tip>
When you receive this error, wait before making additional requests. Check the response headers for rate limit information.
</Tip>

```json
{
  "message": "Rate limit exceeded"
}
```

### 5xx Server Errors

#### 500 Internal Server Error

An unexpected server error occurred on our side (these are rare).

<Danger>
These errors indicate a problem on our end. If you consistently receive 500 errors, please contact support.
</Danger>

```json
{
  "message": "Internal server error"
}
```

```json
{
  "message": "internal server error, please try again later"
}
```

## Validation Errors

When request validation fails, you'll receive a `400 Bad Request` with a descriptive message:

### Request Body Validation

```json
{
  "message": "invalid request body"
}
```

### Field-Specific Validation

The API provides specific validation messages for individual fields:

```json
{
  "message": "invalid domain name, please provider a valid fully qualified domain name."
}
```

```json
{
  "message": "limit must be between 1 and 100"
}
```

### Security-Related Validation

```json
{
  "message": "domain is banned to protect our network from abuse and spammers. if you think this is an error please contact support"
}
```

## Scope and Permission Errors

When your API key doesn't have sufficient permissions:

### Missing Scopes

```json
{
  "message": "sender domain not found in api key scopes"
}
```

### Invalid API Key Context

```json
{
  "message": "invalid api key context"
}
```

## Best Practices

### Error Handling
- Always check the HTTP status code first
- Parse the `message` field for detailed error information
- Implement appropriate retry logic for 5xx errors
- Respect rate limits when receiving 429 responses

### Common Fixes
- **400 errors**: Validate your request parameters and JSON structure
- **401 errors**: Check your API key and authentication headers
- **403 errors**: Verify your API key has the required scopes
- **404 errors**: Confirm the resource exists and belongs to your account
- **429 errors**: Implement exponential backoff in your retry logic

<Note>
Error messages are designed to be descriptive and actionable. They provide specific guidance on what needs to be corrected in your request.
