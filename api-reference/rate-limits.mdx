## Overview

AhaSend API implements rate limiting to ensure fair usage and maintain optimal performance for all users. Rate limits are applied per account and vary depending on the endpoint category.

<Warning>
Rate limits are enforced per account, not per API key. All API keys belonging to the same account share the same rate limit quotas.
</Warning>

## Rate Limit Tiers

### Standard API Endpoints

Most API endpoints are subject to the following rate limits:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Request Rate" icon="gauge-high">
    **100 requests per second**

    Maximum sustained request rate
  </Card>
  <Card title="Burst Capacity" icon="bolt">
    **200 requests**

    Short-term burst allowance
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

**Affected Endpoints:**
- `/v2/accounts/*` - Account management
- `/v2/accounts/{account_id}/api-keys/*` - API key management
- `/v2/accounts/{account_id}/domains/*` - Domain management
- `/v2/accounts/{account_id}/messages/*` - Message operations
- `/v2/accounts/{account_id}/suppressions/*` - Suppression management
- `/v2/accounts/{account_id}/routes/*` - Route management
- `/v2/accounts/{account_id}/webhooks/*` - Webhook management
- `/v2/accounts/{account_id}/smtp-credentials/*` - SMTP credential management

### Statistics API Endpoints

Statistics endpoints have more restrictive rate limits due to their resource-intensive nature:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Request Rate" icon="chart-line">
    **1 request per second**

    Sustained request rate
  </Card>
  <Card title="Burst Capacity" icon="hourglass">
    **1 request**

    No burst allowance
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

**Affected Endpoints:**
- `/v2/accounts/{account_id}/statistics/transactional/deliverability`
- `/v2/accounts/{account_id}/statistics/transactional/bounce`
- `/v2/accounts/{account_id}/statistics/transactional/delivery-time`

## Rate Limit Exceeded Response

When you exceed the rate limit, the API returns a `429 Too Many Requests` status code:

<CodeGroup>
```json Rate Limit Error Response
{
  "message": "Too many requests, rate limited."
}
```
</CodeGroup>

<Info>
The rate limit window uses a sliding window algorithm that resets every second, allowing for smooth request distribution.
</Info>

## Best Practices

### 1. Implement Exponential Backoff

When you receive a 429 response, implement exponential backoff with jitter:

<CodeGroup>
```javascript JavaScript Example
async function makeRequestWithRetry(url, options, maxRetries = 3) {
  for (let attempt = 0; attempt <= maxRetries; attempt++) {
    try {
      const response = await fetch(url, options);

      if (response.status === 429) {
        if (attempt === maxRetries) {
          throw new Error('Rate limit exceeded after max retries');
        }

        // Exponential backoff with jitter
        const delay = Math.pow(2, attempt) * 1000 + Math.random() * 1000;
        await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, delay));
        continue;
      }

      return response;
    } catch (error) {
      if (attempt === maxRetries) throw error;
    }
  }
}
```

```python Python Example
import time
import random
import requests

def make_request_with_retry(url, headers, max_retries=3):
    for attempt in range(max_retries + 1):
        response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)

        if response.status_code == 429:
            if attempt == max_retries:
                raise Exception("Rate limit exceeded after max retries")

            # Exponential backoff with jitter
            delay = (2 ** attempt) + random.random()
            time.sleep(delay)
            continue

        return response
```
</CodeGroup>

### 2. Batch Operations When Possible

For operations that support batching, group multiple items into single requests:

<Tip>
Instead of sending 100 individual message requests, consider using bulk operations or queuing messages to reduce API calls.
</Tip>

### 3. Cache Frequently Accessed Data

Cache static or slowly-changing data like account information and domain lists to reduce unnecessary API calls.

### 4. Use Webhooks for Real-time Updates

Instead of polling endpoints repeatedly, configure webhooks to receive real-time notifications about message status changes and other events.

## Statistics API Considerations

<Warning>
Statistics endpoints have very restrictive rate limits (1 request per second). Plan your analytics queries carefully and consider:

- Caching results for frequently accessed time periods
- Using broader time ranges to reduce query frequency
- Implementing request queuing for multiple statistics calls
</Warning>

## Contact Support

If your application requires higher rate limits due to legitimate high-volume usage patterns, please contact our support team to discuss custom rate limit arrangements.
