<Warning>
**API v1 is in maintenance mode.** We recommend using [API v2](/api-reference/messages/create-message) for new integrations as it offers better features, error handling, and will receive ongoing updates.
</Warning>

<Tip>
Get your API key from the [Credentials](https://dash.ahasend.com/account/-/transactional/credentials) page in your AhaSend dashboard.
</Tip>

API v1 provides a simple way to send emails through AhaSend. It's designed for straightforward email sending without the advanced features available in v2.
