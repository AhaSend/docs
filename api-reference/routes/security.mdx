## Security & Verification

All webhooks include Standard Webhooks security headers for verification:
- `webhook-id`: Unique identifier for the webhook event (used as idempotency key)
- `webhook-timestamp`: Unix timestamp when the webhook was sent
- `webhook-signature`: HMAC signature of the payload using your webhook secret

Use the [Standard Webhooks libraries](https://github.com/standard-webhooks/standard-webhooks) to verify webhook authenticity. See the [verification documentation](https://github.com/standard-webhooks/standard-webhooks/blob/main/spec/standard-webhooks.md#verifying-webhook-authenticity) for implementation details.
