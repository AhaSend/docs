A routing delivery is considered successful as long as your route endpoint returns `2xx` HTTP status codes.

Failed routing for inbound messages are retried **10 times over 7+ hours**.

The retry policy uses an exponential backoff based on how many times the route has errored.
A randomized ±10% jitter is applied to prevent stampeding errors from all retrying at the same time.

```
time to next attempt: unsuccessful attempts ^ 4 + rand(±10%)
```

<Warning>
After 100 consecutive failures, the route is automatically disabled, and all account members will be notified via email.
