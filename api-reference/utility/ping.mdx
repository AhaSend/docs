description: "Health check endpoint for testing API connectivity and authentication"
openapi: "/openapi.yaml GET /v2/ping"
---

The ping endpoint is a simple health check, particularly useful for:

- **API Key Validation**: Test if your API key is valid without performing any other operations
- **Service Health Monitoring**: Check if the AhaSend API is available for automated monitoring systems
- **Connection Testing**: Verify network connectivity before sending important emails
- **Integration Testing**: Validate your authentication setup during development

### Authentication

This endpoint requires a valid API key with **any scope**. It's the most permissive endpoint in the API, making it ideal for basic connectivity testing without requiring specific permissions.
