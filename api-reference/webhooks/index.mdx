Webhooks are user-defined HTTP callbacks that notify your application in real-time when specific events occur in AhaSend. When an email is delivered, bounced, opened, or other events happen, AhaSend sends a POST request to your configured endpoint with detailed event data.

## Overview

AhaSend webhooks follow the [Standard Webhooks specification](https://github.com/standard-webhooks/standard-webhooks), providing:

- **Real-time notifications** for email events (delivery, bounce, open, click, suppression)
- **Secure payload delivery** with HMAC signature verification
- **Automatic retries** up to 6 times over 16+ minutes for failed deliveries
- **Idempotency support** via unique webhook-id headers

## Payload Structure

All webhook events use a consistent JSON structure:

```json
{
  "type": "entity.event",
  "timestamp": "2024-05-06T09:49:16.687031577Z",
  "data": {
    // Event-specific data
  }
}
```

## Security Headers

Every webhook request includes three security headers for verification:

- `webhook-id`: Unique event identifier for idempotency
- `webhook-timestamp`: Unix timestamp when the webhook was sent
- `webhook-signature`: HMAC signature for payload verification
