A webhook delivery is considered successful as long as your webhook endpoint returns `2xx` HTTP status codes.

Failed webhooks are retried **6 times over 16+ minutes**.

The retry policy uses an exponential backoff based on how many times the webhook has errored.
A randomized ±10% jitter is applied to prevent stampeding errors from all retrying at the same time.

```
time to next attempt: unsuccessful attempts ^ 4 + rand(±10%)
```

<Warning>
After 100 consecutive failures, the webhook is automatically disabled, and all account members will be notified via email.
