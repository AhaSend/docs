Get up and running with AhaSend in under 5 minutes. This guide will walk you through sending your first email using either our REST API or SMTP relay.

<Info>
**Before you start:** You'll need an AhaSend account. [Sign up for free](https://dash.ahasend.com/user/register) to get 1,000 emails per month at no cost.
</Info>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Sign Up & Verify Email" icon="user-plus">
    1. **[Sign up for a free account](https://dash.ahasend.com/user/register)**
    2. **Verify your email address** by clicking the link in your inbox
    3. **Log in to your dashboard** to continue setup
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add & Configure Domain" icon="globe">
    Before you can send emails, you need to add and verify your domain:

    1. **Add your domain** in your dashboard under [Domains](https://dash.ahasend.com/account/-/settings/domains)
    2. **Add the DNS records** provided by AhaSend to your domain's DNS settings
    3. **Wait for verification** (usually takes a few minutes)

    <Info>
    **Need help with domain setup?** Check out our detailed [domain configuration guide](/domains) for step-by-step instructions for all major DNS providers.
    </Info>

    <Warning>
    **Important:** You cannot send emails until your domain is verified. The verification process ensures good deliverability and prevents spoofing.
    </Warning>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Choose Sending Method" icon="code">
    Decide how you want to send emails:

    <CardGroup cols={2}>
      <Card title="HTTP API" icon="code" href="#http-api">
        **Recommended for most applications**
        - Faster and more reliable
        - Better error handling
        - Rich metadata support
      </Card>
      <Card title="SMTP Relay" icon="envelope" href="#smtp-relay">
        **Use with existing email libraries**
        - Works with any SMTP-compatible library
        - Easy migration from other providers
        - Supports all programming languages
      </Card>
    </CardGroup>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create Sending Credentials" icon="key">
    Create the appropriate credentials for your chosen method:

    **For HTTP API:**
    - Go to **API Keys** in your dashboard
    - Click "Create API Key"
    - Copy and securely store your API key

    **For SMTP:**
    - Go to **SMTP Credentials** in your dashboard
    - Click "Create SMTP Credential"
    - Save the username and password

    <Warning>
    Keep your credentials secure! Never commit them to version control or expose them in client-side code.
    </Warning>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Send & Verify First Email" icon="paper-plane">
    Send your first email using the code examples below, then verify delivery:

    **After sending:**
    1. **Check your inbox** - Your test email should arrive within seconds
    2. **Check the Messages page** in your dashboard to see delivery status
    3. **Look for a 202 response** with a message ID

    <Check>
    **Success!** See your email in both your inbox and the Messages page? You're all set up! ðŸŽ‰
    </Check>

## HTTP API

Send emails using our modern HTTP API. Perfect for web applications and microservices.

<Info>
**API Version Note:** These examples use our latest API v2, which provides the most powerful features including advanced tracking, bulk sending, and better error handling. For simpler use cases, you can also use our [API v1](/api-reference/v1).
</Info>

### Basic Email

<CodeGroup>

```bash cURL
curl -X POST https://api.ahasend.com/v2/accounts/{account_id}/messages \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{

```

```javascript Node.js

    fmt.Println("Response Status:", resp.Status)
}
```

</CodeGroup>

<Tip>
**Replace the placeholders:**
- `YOUR_API_KEY` with your actual API key from Step 4
- `{account_id}` with your account ID from your dashboard
- `hello@yourdomain.com` with your verified domain from Step 2
- `john@example.com` with the recipient's email address
</Tip>

## SMTP Relay

Use our SMTP servers with any email library. Great for existing applications or when you need SMTP compatibility.

### SMTP Settings

```
Host: send.ahasend.com
Ports: 25, 587, 2525 (all support STARTTLS)
Authentication: Required
Username: Your SMTP username (from dashboard)
Password: Your SMTP password (from dashboard)
```

<Info>
**Get SMTP credentials:** You should have created these in Step 4. If not, go to your dashboard â†’ Credentials â†’ Create New Credential
</Info>

### SMTP Examples

<CodeGroup>

```javascript Node.js (Nodemailer)
const nodemailer = require('nodemailer');

const transporter = nodemailer.createTransporter({
  host: 'send.ahasend.com',
  port: 587,
  secure: false, // true for 465, false for other ports
  auth: {
    user: 'YOUR_SMTP_USERNAME',
    pass: 'YOUR_SMTP_PASSWORD'
  }
});

const mailOptions = {
  from: '"My App" <hello@yourdomain.com>',
  to: 'john@example.com',
  subject: 'Welcome to My App!',
  text: 'Thanks for signing up. We\'re excited to have you!',
  html: '<h1>Welcome!</h1><p>Thanks for signing up. We\'re <strong>excited</strong> to have you!</p>'
};

transporter.sendMail(mailOptions, (error, info) => {
  if (error) {
    console.error('Error:', error);
  } else {
    console.log('Email sent:', info.response);
  }
});

## Next Steps

Now that you've sent your first email, here's what to do next:

    **Add and verify domains** for better deliverability and custom from addresses
  </Card>
  <Card title="Send with SMTP" icon="envelope" href="/smtp">
    **Use SMTP credentials** to send emails through your existing email libraries

## Troubleshooting

Having issues? Here are the most common problems:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="401 Unauthorized Error">
    - Check that your API key is correct and properly formatted
    - Make sure you're using the `Authorization: Bearer` header format
    - Verify your API key has the correct scopes in your dashboard
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Domain Still Not Verified">
    - DNS changes can take up to 24 hours to propagate
    - Double-check that you added all required DNS records exactly as shown
    - Use a DNS checker tool to verify your records are live
    - Contact support if verification fails after 24 hours
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="SMTP Authentication Failed">
    - Double-check your SMTP username and password
    - Make sure you created SMTP credentials in your dashboard (not your login password)
    - Try port 2525 if 587 is blocked by your network
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Email Not Delivered">
    - Check your dashboard message logs for delivery status
    - Verify the recipient email address is correct
    - Check the recipient's spam folder
    - Make sure you're not hitting rate limits (1,000 emails/month on free plan)
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
